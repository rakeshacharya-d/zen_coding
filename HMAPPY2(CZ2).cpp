/*
Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are N problems in this contest; 
each problem has a unique problem code between 1 and N inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to 
split the problems to solve between them â€• Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are 
divisible by A but not divisible by B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are 
divisible by B but not divisible by A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible 
by both A and B).*/
